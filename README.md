## Theme installation

Install Sage by copying the project into a new folder within your WordPress themes directory.

Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) has been installed before moving on.

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
# @ example.com/site/web/app/themes/
$ composer create-project roots/sage your-theme-name 8.5.4
```

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).
